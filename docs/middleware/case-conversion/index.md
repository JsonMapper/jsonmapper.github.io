title: Case conversion

The case conversion middleware can map from a specific text notation to another text notation.
 This way your code doesn't need to follow the same text notation as the JSON API exposes.
 
```php
$mapper = (new \JsonMapper\JsonMapperFactory())->default();

# Add the middleware to convert from studly caps to camel case
$mapper->push(new \JsonMapper\Middleware\CaseConversion(
    \JsonMapper\Enums\TextNotation::STUDLY_CAPS(),
    \JsonMapper\Enums\TextNotation::CAMEL_CASE()
));

$object = new \Tests\JsonMapper\Implementation\SimpleObject();
$mapper->mapObjectFromString('{ "Name": "John Doe" }', $object);

echo $object->getName(); // "John Doe"
```  

The case conversion middleware currently supports the following text notations:
* **Studly caps**
* **Camel case**
* **Underscore**
* **Kebab case**
